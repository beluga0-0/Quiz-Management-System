# Quiz Management System in C++

This is a console-based Quiz Management System developed in C++ as a basic project to demonstrate core programming concepts, file handling, and object-oriented programming (OOP). The system supports both Admin and Student interfaces, allowing quiz creation, modification, and participation.

## Features

- **User Roles**
  - **Admin**: Can add, edit, delete, and view quiz questions.
  - **Student**: Can attempt quizzes and view results.

- **Quiz Functionalities**
  - Multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
  - Real-time result generation after quiz completion
  - Simple login interface for both Admin and Student

- **File Handling**
  - Persistent data storage using text files
  - Stores questions and user results

## Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- Platform: Console Application
- Concepts: File I/O, Conditional Statements, Loops, Functions, Classes

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quiz-management-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and compile the program using any C++ compiler:
   ```bash
